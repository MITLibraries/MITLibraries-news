## TO DOs

When importing ACF fields, current ACF fields must be deleted. Any posts that use those fields must then be updated, after the import, in order to ensure their data is displayed properly. This is particularly important for custom field content that appears on the homepageâ€”the News posts WP API call will fail if those posts are not updated after the new ACF fields are imported.
